The first step in this TDD process was to generate user stories. For our project we decided 
to create a database manager that can be used by librarians. The stories are as follows:

-User Stories-
1. Librarian can add a book to the database.
2. Librarian can query database by title, author first/last, genre, publish year, page number, 
   checked in/out, and/or book ID.
3. Librarian can edit a book's information.
4. Librarian can remove a book from the database.
5. Librarian can check books in and out.

Step two is to create our first happy path test for the first user story. The test will 
initially be: 

@Test public void addBookTest() {
        String[] bookArr = {"Moby Dick", "That Man", "Adventure", "1969", "200"};
        lib.addBook(bookArr[0], bookArr[1], bookArr[2], bookArr[3], bookArr[4]);
        Assert.assertArrayEquals(bookArr, lib.books.get(0));
    }

Now we will implement our addBook() method:

void addBook(String T, String A, String G, String Y, String P){
    books.add(new String[A_NUM]);
    String[] book = books.get(books.size() - 1);

    book[0] = String.valueOf(books.size() - 1);
    book[1] = "In";
    book[2] = T;
    book[3] = A;
    book[4] = G;
    book[5] = Y;
    book[6] = P;
}

After we created our addBook() method, we noticed that there was an error in our code.
We originally compared our bookArr array from the addBookTest() method to the array
stored in our Library. This is not correct and our test revealed this error. Although
the actual method was implemented correctly, it is good to ensure that your tests work
properly as well.

Our updated addBookTest() method is where we addded two new elements to our bookArr:

@Test public void addBookTest() {
    String[] bookArr = {"0", "In", "Moby Dick", "That Man", "Adventure", "1969", "200"};
    lib.addBook(bookArr[2], bookArr[3], bookArr[4], bookArr[5], bookArr[6]);
    Assert.assertArrayEquals(bookArr, lib.books.get(0));
}

Now our first happy path test is passing!










2. queryBookTest()
3. editBookTest()
4. removeBookTest()
