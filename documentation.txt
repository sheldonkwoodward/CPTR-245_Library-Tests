The first step in this TDD process was to generate user stories. For our project we decided 
to create a database manager that can be used by librarians. The stories are as follows:

-User Stories-
1. Librarian can add a book to the database.
2. Librarian can query database by title, author first/last, genre, publish year, page number, 
   checked in/out, and/or book ID.
3. Librarian can edit a book's information.
4. Librarian can remove a book from the database.

Step two is to create our first happy path test for the first user story. The test will 
be addBookTest().















2. queryBookTest()
3. editBookTest()
4. removeBookTest()
